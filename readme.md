Description of Moonbase
Moonbase might as well be called "SimMoonbase": it is a simulation of mankind's first base on the moon. You can build living modules, oxygen production plant, science labs, and a few more buildings. The building types are very limited, and the goal seems to be just maximizing your income from shipping production (helium, etc.) to earth. A small, interesting simulation that unfortunately offers much fewer options and replay value than SimCity.
